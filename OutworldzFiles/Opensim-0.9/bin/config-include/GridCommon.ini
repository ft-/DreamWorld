; anything later ought to be fine as well).
;
; For this to work you need to obtain an admin account from Vivox
; that allows you to create voice accounts and region channels.

[AutoBackupModule]

;
;AutoBackupModuleEnabled: True/False. Default: False. If False, every
;function in the module is as no-op as possible: just return as soon as
;realizing that we're not enabled. Otherwise it will try to get as far as it
;can with auto backup for each region.
; Global (in OpenSim.ini) or Per-Region (in Regions/Regions.ini under theregion's name's section)
; IMPORTANT: Settings declared per-region in Regions/Regions.ini override
;settings in OpenSim.ini. Settings in OpenSim.ini, in turn, override
;hard-coded defaults.  AutoBackup: True/False. Default: False. If True,
;activate auto backup functionality. This is the only required option for
;enabling auto-backup; the other options have sane defaults. If False, the
;auto-backup module becomes a no-op for the region, and all other
;AutoBackup* settings are ignored.
; AutoBackupModuleEnabled: True/False. Default: False. If False, every
;function in the module is as no-op as possible: just return as soon as
;realizing that we're not enabled. Otherwise it will try to get as far as it
;can with auto backup for each region.
; AutoBackupInterval: Integer, non-negative value. Default: 720 (12
;hours). The number of minutes between each backup attempt. If a negative or
;zero value is given, it is equivalent to setting AutoBackup = False.
; AutoBackupBusyCheck: True/False. Default: True. If True, we will only
;take an auto-backup if a set of conditions are met. These conditions are
;heuristics to try and avoid taking a backup when the sim is busy.
; AutoBackupScript: String. Default: not specified (disabled). File path
;to an executable script or binary to run when an automatic backup is taken.
;argv[1] of the executed file/script will be the file name of the generated
;OAR. If the process can't be spawned for some reason (file not found, no
;execute permission, etc), write a warning to the console.
; AutoBackupNaming: string. Default: Time.  One of three strings (case
;insensitive):
;  "Time": Current timestamp is appended to file name. An existing file
;will never be overwritten.
;  "Sequential": A number is appended to the file name. So if
;RegionName_x.oar exists, we'll save to RegionName_{x+1}.oar next. An
;existing file will never be overwritten.
;  "Overwrite": Always save to file named "RegionName.oar", even if we
;have to overwrite an existing file.
; AutoBackupDir: String. Default: "." (the current directory). A directory
;(absolute or relative) where backups should be saved. If the path is not a
;directory, or insufficient permissions are available, a warning will be
;printed to the console and no backups will be taken.
; AutoBackupDilationThreshold: float. Default: 0.5. Lower bound on time
;dilation required for BusyCheck heuristics to pass.  If the time dilation
;is below this value, don't take a backup right now.
; AutoBackupAgentThreshold: int. Default: 10. Upper bound on # of agents
;in region required for BusyCheck heuristics to pass.  If the number of
;agents is greater than this value, don't take a backup right now.
; AutoBackupKeepFilesForDays: int. Default: 0.
;   1) number of days to keep backups (0 the default value will disable
;this option).
;   2) After each backup, remove all oars in the backup directory that are
;older than the specified number of days.
;    note: if the user set the bin directory as the backup location, only
;oar files are removed. There is no way to know if an oar was created by
;auto-backup, or manually created or uploaded. It is not recommended to use
;the bin directory for your auto backups for this reason.
