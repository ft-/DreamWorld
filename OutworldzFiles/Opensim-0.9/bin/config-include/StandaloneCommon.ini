; AutoBackupDir: String. Default: "." (the current directory). A directory
;(absolute or relative) where backups should be saved. If the path is not a
;directory, or insufficient permissions are available, a warning will be
;printed to the console and no backups will be taken.
; AutoBackupDilationThreshold: float. Default: 0.5. Lower bound on time
